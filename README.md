# Mobile Web Development Final Project
## Synopsys


The goal of this project is to redesign the existing website located at www.southhuronind.com utilizing the methods outlined throughout this course. It should be noted that this is more than just an exercise practicing learned techniques and skills, but an actual project. South Huron Industrial and I have been working closely on a strategy to update their old, now defunct, website for several months.


## The Client


South Huron Industrial is a company that specializes in Dust Control; Ice Control; and other various services that provide safe outdoor work and living environments. They service the greater Southeast Michigan area as well as some outlying townships and farming communities.


## Why South Huron Industrial?


The original site was actually designed by a colleague of mine back in 2009. She has since moved on from web design to other interests and is unavailable to take on the project herself. As a result she entrusted her former client to me.


## Motivation


South Huron Industrial is anxious to get their website redesigned as soon as possible. The original site was designed in 2009 using a WYSIWYG editor called called Site Spinner. The editor did a rather messy job generating reams of javascript and inline CSS that makes the original HTML files relatively impossible to decypher. In addition to the excess code it was written using HTML 4.01; much of which is now deprecated leaving the site looking physically misaligned and dilapidated.


## Initial Approach


The existing code is too much of a mess to even consider repair. Redesign from the ground up is the only logical solution. Since the client uses the site to showcase their products and services (which never change or vary in any way) the current content can be simply copied and pasted into a clean HTML document. Other issues such as custom graphics and existing logos must be replaced and redesigned. The old logo is animated and the result of two separate graphics that are currently sitting out of alignment with the rest of the document; likely the result of deprecated HTML from v4.01. To fix these problems all graphics will be designed from scratch. All text content will be pasted into a fresh document as outlined above and the site will be created using a "mobile first" approach.
